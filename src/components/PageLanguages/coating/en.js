Despite the many positive properties of concrete, this material has one major drawback: untreated concrete floors will release (fine) dust over time. To keep the dust load to a minimum, we recommend having the concrete floor coated or impregnated. Computer floors can also become scratched and/or slippery. An anti-slip layer can often largely eliminate these disadvantages.",
