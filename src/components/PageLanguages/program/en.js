  p1: "No matter how good the architectural construction, choice of materials and preventive measures are, pollution will continue to occur daily as a result of human actions.",
  p2: "To achieve an optimal cleaning result, RIFCO has developed a two-year cycle data center hygiene plan. This shortens the interval between two cleaning cycles without exponentially increasing costs. This reduces the risk of (fine) dust formation, eliminating an important cause of malfunctions. Due to the optimal distribution and structure of the activities throughout the year, a perfect cleaning result is achieved.",
  p3: "Before the start of the work, we always carry out a review / audit, during which the findings and advice are shared with the customer",
  p4: "In addition to our specific data center cleaning approach, RIFCO often also carries out one-off / start-up activities after renovations, new construction deliveries or after incidents.",
  p5: "The fact that RIFCO's specific cost-saving cleaning approach works translates into the fact that RIFCO now cleans many thousands of mÂ² of floor space in data center, but also in smaller computer and server rooms",
